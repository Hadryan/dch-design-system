# Digital Concert Hall

The Berliner Philharmonikerâ€™s **Digital Concert Hall** \(DCH\) is a ticket- or subscription-based video streaming service for classical music concerts, films and interviews, available on many platforms and devices. It is operated by the Berlin Phil Media GmbH, a wholly owned start-up subsidiary of the Berliner Philharmoniker Foundation, financed through its own revenues.

The orchestra plays about 50 concert programmes per season with usually three consecutive performances each. Only the last performance is streamed live to a paying public while the prior live performances are used for technical testing and studio rehearsals.

With few exceptions, the Digital Concert Hall features **only** concerts performed by the Berliner Philharmoniker. The broad repertoire of pieces and the wide roster of world class conductors and soloists ensure that the service provides enough variation.

The Digital Concert Hall is used by customers all around the world and is offered in multiple languages.



## Goals

### Users

#### Keep paying customers satisfied

Paying users must be reminded and inspired to keep using the service.

#### Catch new users

Any Digital Concert Hall application functions as a primary point of contact for a potential new user. It must explain in short and clear terms what the value of the Digital Concert Hall is and offer an incentive for the user to register for the service.

#### Convert users to paying customers

The application must clearly communicate in a friendly manner what content and which functions are reserved for paying customers and nudge the user towards becoming a paying customer.

### Content

The Digital Concert Hall shall not only feature its own ever growing library of concert video productions from the year of its inception in 2008 but also as many historic concert recordings as possible.

Besides concert related video content such as concerts and their related interviews, films in the form of documentaries or artist portraits provide a substantial additional benefit to familiarize customers with classical music in general and the Berliner Philharmoniker and their conductors in particular. Therefore the film archive should grow as well.

In 2016 streaming of lossless audio files was added to the DCH. Beginning with the recordings of Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings this section should be extended. It should ideally cover as much of the existing audio recordings with the orchestra as possible.

### Technology

The Digital Concert Hall should offer the best experience to explore, watch and listen to classical music recordings on any platform supported by the service. DCH clients should be the benchmark solution for this purpose on each platform. Therefore clients should adapt as platform specific best practice solutions while maintaining the core feature set and workflows of the DCH.

We want to reach this goal while balancing costs and benefits of our efforts.

#### Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.

This equally accounts for data structures, code, interfaces and workflows. If a feature or workflow can be made possible with a simpler solution, refactoring always is an option.

#### Prefer solutions that are stable and efficient in the long term.

#### Prefer open source technologies.

#### Experiment with new technologies

We welcome experiments and tests of new technologies as well as joint projects with other companies or institutions in the areas of hardware and software. The primary goal should be to improve the core product or make better user experiences possible in the future.
