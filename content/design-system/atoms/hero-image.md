## Visual Reference

### General Rules

* Original images are usually 16:9
* On very narrow (or very wide) screens, avoid images being disproportionately small by cropping the **sides** (_never_ top or bottom)
* Calculate image height proportional to available screen height

Click images for up-to-date measurements and features.

### XS

* Bottom distance ~2.5x image height

### S
[![](/images/atoms/hero-image/s.png)](https://zpl.io/be1p8ZN)

* Bottom distance ~1.5x image height

### M
[![](/images/atoms/hero-image/m.png)](https://zpl.io/2jkxLGm)

* On _portrait_, use full-width image
* On _landscape_, crop to ensure ~1/4 image height from bottom
* Image should never be 100% height

## Gradient

* Whenever content is overlaid on the hero image, a **gradient** must be used
* Define this gradient
