## Usage

Action Toggles are used when an on/off action is available. Examples include selecting a work as a Favorite, or downloading for offline viewing.


## Variants

## States

Toggle buttons have two states - On and Off. When pressed these toggles will switch to the other state, and perform the accompanying action. When a toggle action causes content to be removed (like when marking something as unavailable offline), a confirmation dialog should be displayed to avoid mistakes.

Action Toggles that trigger actions requiring time to complete are accompanied by a Progress Indicator. Make sure there is ample space for the Indicator in the design.
