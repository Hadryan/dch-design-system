# Thumbnail

![](/images/atoms/hero-image/xs.png)

## Overview

This is an image element that appears in smaller modules. It may appear small, or very small, so images should be chosen accordingly.

## Goals

* Represent content visually
* Hint at context of the item
* Add impact to every item presented

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Specs" %}

## Visual Reference

### General Rules

* Original images are usually 16:9
* On very narrow elements, avoid images being disproportionately small by cropping the **sides** (_never_ top or bottom)

Click images for up-to-date measurements and features.
