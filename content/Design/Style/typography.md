{% tab title="Overview" %}

Typography on the DCH Platform aims to replicate the feel of the Berliner Philharmoniker brand in a visual way, while feeling at home on each digital platform seperately. With a quite neutral family as the baseline, default platform typefaces are used with certain spacing techniques to create the same look and feel across all devices, yet each version feels at home on the OS in question. 
The feel of type is much more defined by the space around it, the line-height and its role in the vertical rhythm of the design, the tracking between the letters, and the weight of the type. By focusing on limited but powerful text styles across the whole platform, we can then offer OS-specific variations on type treatment for those styles.

## Typeface

The brand typeface for Berliner Philharmoniker is Akzidenz Grotesk. To convey the same feeling on digital platforms, it is important to use a sans-serif Grotesque with certain guidelines for each alternative. It is also a plus if the typeface selected feels at home on the respective platform. Hereâ€™s a list of the alternatives:

| Platform | Typeface         |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| iOS      | San Francisco    |
| Android  | Roboto           |
| Web      | Helvetica, Arial |
| Windows  | Segoe UI         |
| Roku     | Roku System Font |


## Type Scale

The DCH Design System uses a 8pt grid with a 4pt baseline grid. Certain type sizes have been carefully selected to compliment that grid. 

| Type Size | Line-Height | Size Ratio |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 10        | 16          | 0.625      |
| 12        | 16          | 0.75       |
| 14        | 20          | 0.875      |
| 16        | 24          | 1          |
| 18        | 24          | 1.125      |
| 28        | 36          | 1.75       |
| 32        | 40          | 2          |

Paragraph spacing = 1 x **line-height**


## Type Styles


If a new feature or unit is impossible to design without adding a new style, it needs to go through a design review and then be added into the Design System before being implemented anywhere. New styles should have potential use cases beyond just the newest element designed.

Type Styles are separated into three groups:

* Headers - Styles that define either a page or a part of it
* Body - Anything that exists within the flow of the page content
* Elements - Unique visual elements like buttons, labels, where space is limited

## Type Colors

Colors are separated from style for greater flexibility. Most type is defined by contrast. High is the default value and does not need to be specified.
