## 8-Point Grid System

DCH Design System uses the 8-point Grid System to make sure spacing within and between elements stays consistent throughout the layout. It also reduces guesswork when it comes to interpreting reference files, and allows both designers to remove guesswork when creating new elements, as well as developers to make educated guesses if they are in any doubt about implementation.

The 8-point system should also be applied to margins, typography and basically any element with a unit measurement. But also remember that exceptions can prove a rule - Only deviate from the 8px grid system when the user experience is greatly improved by it. 

## Spacing Philosophy

While spacing is clearly defined in the specs for each element, from Atoms all the way up to Components, it's good to have the general philosophy in action in mind. Since DCH includes a lot of visual content, ranging from images to video, it's important to allow content to breathe with ample whitespace between elements, especially vertically. When applying margins to components, keep it on the generous side - but best is to look at already established components for inspiration.
