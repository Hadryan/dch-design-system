Molecules are specific combinations of Atoms that stay together as a cohesive unit, but can still appear in more than one instance on the platform. Sometimes these molecules have variables, for example a Molecule that consists of multiple buttons could have 2 or 3, depending on the page it appears on. But the behaviour of the module (spacing, position within layout, etc) Stays the same.
