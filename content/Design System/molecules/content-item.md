{% tab title="Overview" %}

Content Items (CI) are visual representations of the DCH catalog, used for browsing. They should contain just enough information to help users find their desired content, and look visually appealing and inviting.

## Types

Depending on context, a CI may appear in two modes:

* Card
  * Designed for short, horizontal lists (max. 30 items)
  * Elements are bigger, get more attention
  * Should never be in a mosaic

* Compact
  * Optimized for quickly browsing bigger lists
  * Compact yet informative
  * Can appear in lists/stacks

## Goals

* At-a-glance identification of media items
* Engage and invite to view item/read more information

{% tab title="Card" %}

## Card Format
Cards are big and bold, so they're great for browsing smaller row-based lists, but due to their size, not so great for large collections.
